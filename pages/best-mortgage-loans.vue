                How Does the Mortgage Loan Process Work?
              </h5>
            </div>
            <div class="question-content">
              <p>
                Whether you are buying a home or refinancing one, the mortgage
                process is basically similar to one another. Here is an
                introductory look at what happens when you’re
                mortgaging/refinancing a home:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Turn In Mortgage Application</strong> – The majority
                  of home lenders provide an online application process. Fill it
                  out, submit the form along with pertinent documentation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Wait To Receive Loan Estimate</strong> – A lender is
                  required to give you an estimate within three business days of
                  a submitted application. The document needs to entail three
                  things –
                  <a
                    href="/mortgage-loan-calculator"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    target="_blank"
                    >monthly mortgage rate</a
                  >, estimated interest rate and closing costs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Set Up A Home Inspection</strong> – Be sure to
                  communicate with the seller about dates and times for a home
                  inspection. An inspection will help uncover potential
                  problems.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Get A Home Appraisal</strong> – Ask your lender to
                  provide you with an appraiser to determine the home’s value.
                  You will need to pay for this appraisal.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Buy Homeowners Insurance</strong> – This is a
                  necessity before a bank approves a loan.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Wait Until Underwriting Is Completed</strong> – You’ll
                  need to wait for the bank to prepare the loan documents, and
                  it can take some time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Begin Underwriting Process</strong> – Underwriters,
                  using manual or automated systems, can take days or weeks to
                  approve or decline loans.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Review Closing Disclosure Documents</strong> – Within
                  three business days, the loan documents will arrive. Be sure
                  to review the mortgage documents before signing. You want to
                  compare the disclosure to the lender’s recent loan estimate to
                  ensure no significant changes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Close On The Loan – At this point, all parties involved in the
                  mortgage transaction will need to sign the pertinent
                  documents. Afterward, you pay the closing costs and down
                  payment.
                </li>
              </ul>

                8 Steps To Applying For A Home Mortgage
              </h5>
            </div>
            <div class="question-content">
              <p>
                The mortgage interest rate is the yearly cost of financing your
                home, noted in a percentage of the loan amount. For example, a
                2.75% interest rate on your mortgage means an additional 2.75%
                on the remaining balance is added.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are two types of interest rates: fixed and adjustable.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Fixed-Rate</strong></p>
              <p>
                With a fixed-rate mortgage, the interest rate stays the same
                throughout the life of the loan. This means
                <a

                  rel="noopener noreferrer"
                  target="_blank"
                  >the monthly mortgage payment</a
                >
                also remains the same. You don’t have to worry about increasing
                costs, but you don’t benefit unless you choose to refinance if
                the market drops.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fixed-rate mortgages tend to have a higher initial monthly
                payment because the lender is unable to raise the interest rate
                when the market dictates it.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Adjustable-Rate</strong></p>
              <p>
                If you have an adjustable-rate mortgage, the interest rate is
                tied to the market rates. It’s subjected to the market’s
                movements, using a benchmark rate (i.e., prime rate). When the
                benchmark rate increases, your monthly mortgage payment will
                increase. When it falls, your mortgage payment will also
                decline.
              </p>
              <p>
                This kind of rate is only ideal when you’re going to sell or
                refinance your home before an increase in rates or if you
                believe there were be a decline in the market.
              </p>
              <p>
                How do you know which one is best for you? It will depend on
                three things:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Market conditions</li>
                <li>Your individual finances</li>
                <li>How long you intend to maintain the mortgage</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                When it comes to determining your mortgage interest rate, there
                are several factors that lenders will consider of you, the home,
                the loan, and current economic conditions. Such factors are:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Property type and use</li>

              </ul>
              <p>
                When looking at the different offers, it’s important to consider
                the annual percentage rate (APR) and interest rate percentage.
                The interest rate calculates how much you’re borrowing every
                year. The APR denotes the interest rate as well as the
                origination fees, discount points and closing costs

                8 Steps To Applying For A Home Mortgage
              </h6>
              <p>
                Be sure to begin the mortgage pre-approval process before you
                look at homes. This is important for three reasons:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  You’ll know how much you are approved for and can look for
                  homes in that price range.
                </li>
                <li>Many sellers required buyers to be pre-approved.</li>
                <li>
                  Pre-approval means you can submit an offer as soon you find
                  the home you want to buy.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>From that point, here is what you’ll need to do:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Analyze Your Credit History</strong> – Look at your
                  credit report and its history before
                  <a

                    >applying for a mortgage</a
                  >. If there are any mistakes (that affect the score), address
                  them immediately with all three credit bureaus – TransUnion,
                  Experian and Equifax. If your score is low, make sure to
                  improve them first.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Prepare Documents</strong> – The bank will request pay
                  stubs, bank account statements, and tax returns to be
                  submitted with the loan application.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Compare Shop With Different Lenders</strong> – If you
                  comparison shop in a 45-day window, your credit score will
                  suffer only slightly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Review Offers</strong> – Any lender you applied with
                  will give you a loan estimate that includes monthly payment,
                  interest rate, closing costs and other important information.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Pick Your Lender</strong> – Once you’ve reviewed each
                  loan term,
                  <a
                    href="/mortgage-loan"

                  >.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Ensure Quick Responses To Any Requests Made</strong> –
                  When your loan goes through the processing and underwriting,
                  the lender may request something. Be sure to respond as
                  quickly as you can to move this process along faster.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Review Closing Disclosure</strong> – The lender is
                  required to give you a closing disclosure, showing you the
                  final mortgage costs, the interest rate, fees, etc., within
                  three business days of the closing date scheduled. Look at the
                  closing disclosure and the loan estimate they initially
                  provided to determine if and why fees changed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Close On The Home</strong> – At the closing, you’ll
                  sign a plethora of documents to ensure the home reverts to
                  your possessions. You will also be required to pay the down
                  payment and up to 5% closing costs.

                How To Find The Best Possible Mortgage Lender

            <div class="question-content">
              <p>
                When looking at each mortgage company, there are four factors to
                consider:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Interest Rate</strong> – Interest will vary by product
                  and lender; make sure you’re comparison shopping to find the
                  best possible deal
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Closing Costs</strong> – Closing costs will include
                  the application, loan origination and appraisal fees, so even
                  though a lender offers a low rate compared to others, the
                  mortgage costs may not make it the best. Use the APR to
                  compare the lenders’ offers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Product Offerings</strong> – Look for a state-licensed

                  <strong>Customer Service Reviews</strong> – Read reviews and
                  feedback to learn more about the lender. You want lenders who

                What Kind Of Mortgage Will Suit You?
              </h5>
            </div>
            <div class="question-content">
              <p>
                Your individual situation – plans, preferences and finances –
                will dictate what the best mortgage is. The most common kind of
                mortgages are:
              </p>
              <p><strong>Adjustable-Rate Mortgages</strong></p>
              <p>
                Monthly payments and interest rates are affected by the market,
                which means you could pay more or less during the life of the
                loan. Early adjustable-rate mortgages are low, but rates can
                spike unexpectedly (leaving some borrowers unable to pay).
              </p>
              <p><strong>Balloon Mortgages</strong></p>
              <p>
                These are loans with short-term interest payments of five to 10
                years, which then require the homeowner to make a lump sum
                payment. This may be ideal for individuals who are going to sell
                or refinance the home before the impending balloon payment is
                due.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Conforming Loans</strong></p>
              <p>
                The loans are subjected to the limits and guidelines as laid out
                by
                <strong

                and Freddie Mac.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Conventional Mortgages</strong></p>
              <p>
                These mortgages originate from private lenders and are not
                federally backed by the government. To qualify, private lenders
                want a minimum 620 credit score, a low debt-to-income ratio and
                a minimum 3% down payment. Any down payment less than 20% must
                include private mortgage insurance.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Fixed-Rate Mortgages</strong></p>
              <p>
                Loans with a fixed rate mean payments and interest rate remain
                the same (great for budgeters). However, if the rate falls, you
                will need to refinance if you want to benefit financially.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Government-Backed Loans</strong></p>
              <p>
                These are loans from the Department of Agriculture, Department
                of Veterans Affairs and Federal Housing Administration. If you
                are unable to get a convention loan, you could attain a
                government-backed loan.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>

                    ></strong
                  >
                  – The majority of FHA-backed lenders want a minimum of 580 in
                  credit score and a 3.5% down payment. However, you could be
                  approved if you agree to pay a 10% down payment even if your
                  credit score is 500 to 579.

                    ></strong
                  >
                  – The VA has no requirements about down payments or credit
                  score minimums, but a lender will do an in-depth analysis of
                  your financial profile. A lender will need to see the
                  Certificate of Eligibility (COE) that shows you are eligible
                  for a VA loan.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>USDA</strong> – The majority of lenders who do USDA
                  loans do not require money down but a minimum of 640 credit
                  score. A home must be located in a permissible rural area, and
                  you have to meet specific income requirements.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Nonconforming Loans</strong></p>
              <p>
                These are jumbo or government-backed loans that don’t meet the
                criteria set forth by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Jumbo loans
                surpass the limits of a conforming loan and have stringent
                qualifications for eligibility due to lenders’ risk.
