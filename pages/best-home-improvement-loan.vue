        <div class="question-content">
          <p>This FAQs section will guide first-time readers regarding home improvement loans.</p>
          <h6 class="question-title">What is personal loan?</h6>
          <p>Money borrowed from financial institutions such as banks, online lenders, credit unions is called personal
            loan. Personal loan donot require collateral. If someone qualifies for the loan, he will have <a
              href="/personal-loan-calculator" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">to pay monthly payments</a> to
            payback the amount. </p>
          <h6 class="question-title">How to use home improvement loan?</h6>
          <p>The type of project you are undertaking with the loan proceeds, as well as how the value of your property
            will increase, can be taken into account by the lender. You can also use <a
              href="/guides/what-kind-of-loan-do-you-need" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">home renovation
              loans</a> to improve
            the look of your home, such as a kitchen or bathroom remodel. Pools, terraces and extras can be plans that
            you make with your loan money.</p>
          <p>Lastly, you should check with each lender to determine if your desired home repair plan is eligible. They
            can place restrictions on structural difficulties or they can be more independent in how you spend your
            money.</p>

          <h6 class="question-title">How can you apply for home improvement loan?</h6>
          <p><a href="/best-home-improvement-loan" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Qualifying for the home
            improvement loan</a> is similar to the qualification of other loans. You have to
            provide social security number from which lender will pull out you credit score. Credit score will define
            your interest rate and amount and loan term. For the apply you have to provide information of income tax
            returns, bank statements, pay stubs. Income will be compared with debt obligations for the qualification. If
            someone has less credit points, then credit unions will be the best options for them as they will provide
            better loan options. </p>

          <h6 class="question-title">Does personal loan hurt your credit?</h6>
          <p>You will receive a rigorous credit check when you <a href="/guides/how-to-apply-a-personal-loan"
                                                                  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">apply for a
            personal loan</a> to establish your credibility.
            This can result in a small drop in your credit score. However, this is usually only temporary and your
            credit score will reset in a few months.</p>
          <p>Also, personal loans can have a positive <a href="/guides/how-your-credit-score-affects-your-loan-chances"
                                                         rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">effect on your credit
            score</a> in a number of ways. For example, if
            you pay your debts on time or you can diversify your credit mix with a personal loan, your credit score may
            improve.</p>
          <p>Finally, the credit benefits of a personal loan can outweigh the initial losses.</p>
          <h6 class="question-title">Can I get personal loan with bad credit?</h6>
          <p>Yes, there are many lenders who offer personal loans <a href="/guides/how-to-get-a-loan-with-bad-credit"
                                                                     rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">to people
            with bad credit</a>. For example, you may be
            able to get a loan from some lenders with a credit score of 600 or less. However, keep in mind that the
            interest rate on these loans is higher than on loans for people with strong credit.</p>
          <p>If you have a terrible credit history and are having trouble getting approved, consider applying with an
            endorsement. Co-signers are not allowed by all personal lenders, although some are. Having a co-signer can
            also allow you to qualify for a lower interest rate than you would otherwise qualify.</p>
          <p>The second option is to focus on improving your credit so that you can apply for loans in the future with
            better rates and conditions.</p>
