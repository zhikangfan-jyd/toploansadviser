              The US Department of Veteran Affairs backs Veteran Affairs (VA)
              Loan. Since the loan has the guarantee of a well-reputed
              government agency, it brings ease and trust to the potential
              customers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover, lenders feel a tad bit agreeable in providing these
              loans to borrowers since the loan has less risk attached to it.
              Less risky loans mean that there is a lower probability that the
              loan will default.
            </p>
            <p>
              The requirements with the VA loans are also quite flexible as
              there is a minimal down payment on the loan amount, and borrowers
              do not need a fair credit score to apply. Military personnel with
              a bad credit score can also apply for a loan. While this loan is
              only for military families, they still need to have a reasonable
              credit to qualify for the loan to own a house of their own.

              industry. It will also include the minimum requirements that are
              needed to qualify for the VA loan. In addition, the article will

            This FAQs section is for those people who are applying for a VA loan
            for the first time.

          <h6 class="question-title">What is a VA mortgage?</h6>
          <p>
            VA loans are meant for veterans and military personals and their
            families only. The loan is provided by the lenders that the US
            Department approves of Veteran Affairs to give out loans to specific
            personals. The different VA loans include VA purchase loans, VA
            cash-out refinances loans and VA interest rate reduction loans.
          </p>
          <h6 class="question-title">Do I qualify for a VA mortgage?</h6>
          <p>
            To qualify for a VA loan, certain requirements need to be fulfilled.
            These requirements include that the person or the family seeking the
            loan must have a military background. In addition, they need to meet
            the minimum credit score set by each lender offering VA loans. The
            loans should specifically be used to purchase a house; it serves no
            other purpose. The person must have enough income

              >to cover the monthly payments</a

            needed to pay off the mortgage. Lastly, the DTI ratio should not be
            more than 41%.
          </p>
          <h6 class="question-title">How to choose VA lenders?</h6>
          <p>
            To select the best lender, you will need to carry out a process of
            due diligence and find out the top VA lenders in the market. Apply
            for a pre-approval to know the rates and fees each lender is
            offering. Then with the process of elimination, remove those lenders
            that do not fit with your preference. To choose the best VA loan
            provider, certain factors such as the credit score requirement, down
            payment, fees, and hidden charges should be considered. Finally,
            choose the lender that asks for the lowest overall cost.
