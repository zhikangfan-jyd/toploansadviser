        <h2 class="title">FAQ About Life Insurance </h2>
        <div class="question-content">

          <h6 class="question-title">What You Need to Know to Choose the Right Policy</h6>
          <p>All kinds of life insurance exist, ranging from short-term contracts to lifetime coverage. The right life
            insurance policy is based on many factors, including but not limited to your age, health status, and
            financial goals. What are the different types of life insurance, and how do you know which one fits your
            needs?</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Annuities </strong>
              <p>This insurance contract offers a steady stream of income during your retirement. Funds can be made in
                one lump sum or through the accumulation phase , which begins at the annuitization phase and varies
                based on the contract details.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Final Expense/Burial </strong>
              <p>This life insurance provides funds to cover the burial and funeral costs. These are usually small
                monetary amount policies that may or may not require a medical exam.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Guaranteed Issue</strong>
              <p>This policy is a type of permanent life insurance that provides guaranteed approval for a minute amount
                of coverage, no matter the health status of the person needing it. There is no required medical exam for
                this coverage. </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Indexed</strong>
              <p>This type of universal life insurance policy allows people to invest the cash value collected in market
                indices, such as the S&P 500. A person can borrow the money tax-free.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Term</strong>
              <p>This type of life insurance policy is permitted for a certain period, usually no more than 30 years.
                They also have a high death benefit for a low premium. This life insurance policy is best for young and
                healthy people who need low-cost coverage.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Universal</strong>
              <p>This is another permanent life insurance with flexible premiums and benefit amounts. Policies can build
                cash value that is investable for more growth and can be borrowed against tax-free when necessary.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Whole </strong>
              <p>Another permanent life insurance policy that ensures coverage for a person’s lifetime is the whole life
                insurance policy. This policy can build cash value with interest that is borrowable if needed without a
                tax penalty.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h6 class="question-title">Four Important Life Insurance Keywords to Help You Choose Your Next Policy</h6>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Cash Value</strong>
              <p>Some life insurance policies will allow some portion of the premium to go toward a cash value, which
                earns a fixed interest amount for growth. You can borrow this money without a tax penalty.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Death Benefit</strong>
              <p>This is similar to a policy’s face value, payable to your beneficiaries upon your death. The payout may
                be less if you have ever withdrawn money or taken out loans against the policy’s cash value.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Face Value</strong>
              <p>An insurance policy’s face value is how much money your beneficiary will get after you die, so long as
                the policy is still in effect.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Riders </strong>
              <p>An insurance policy rider is additional coverage you can buy, such as covering your spouse or children,
                payouts in case of accidental death, and the ability to use the funds when you need them. The fee for a
                rider can be either a flat yearly fee or a percentage of the policy’s premium. </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h6 class="question-title">Who Should Purchase a Life Insurance Policy?</h6>

          <p>A life insurance policy offers a level of income protection for your loved ones so that they can pay for
            any debts/obligations and ensures your assets are protected to a degree. If you fit into any of the
            categories below, you should get a life insurance policy:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="/personal-loan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Married</a></li>
            <li>Mortgage holder</li>
            <li>Family’s main provider</li>
            <li>Need coverage for burial and funeral expenses</li>
            <li>Need supplemental retirement income</li>
            <li>Hold large debts</li>
            <li>Own a business</li>
            <li>Desire to accrue tax-deferred cash value</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Bear in mind that these are just a handful of reasons to consider getting a life insurance policy. The
            reality is that most people can benefit from one.</p>
          <h6 class="question-title">
            How Do You Determine How Much Coverage to Attain?
          </h6>
          <dl>
            <dt>Several factors will affect how much coverage you need:</dt>
            <dd>Age</dd>
            <dd>Debt obligations</dd>
            <dd>Family</dd>
            <dd>Income</dd>
            <dd>How long to retirement</dd>
          </dl>
          <p>According to financial professionals, it’s best to get 10x your yearly salary to replace your income. How
            much you really need depends on your current situation. For example, <a href="/mortgage-loan"
                                                                                    rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                                                                    target="_blank">if you
              have a mortgage and are your
              family’s main provider</a> , you may elect to get more than this. Or, you may decide that the final
            expense
            policy is enough. </p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">Example:</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic">David is married with two kids. He currently is the only income earner in his
            household and earns $70,000 a year. Together, the debt load is $500,000 ($100,000 in loans and $400,000 for
            a mortgage). David elects an amount that is 10x his salary for his life insurance coverage with an
            additional $500,000 to deal with the debt obligations. He goes with a 20-year term coverage policy at the
            lowest possible monthly amount. </p>
          <p>The key behind life insurance coverage is to ensure your loved ones don’t have to worry about taking care
            of themselves if you die.</p>
          <h6 class="question-title">How to Find the Right Life Insurance Policy</h6>
          <p>The right life insurance policy is the one that meets your and your family’s needs. Make sure you
            understand what coverage amount is right for you and what the money should be used for after you die. Do you
            want temporary or lifetime coverage? If you like the idea of lifetime coverage, you may find that a term
            policy can save you money and handle all your debt upon your death.</p>
          <p>Determine what you can afford. The majority of policies have a monthly or annual premium with other costs
            for riders. If you want a low monthly premium, you may want a term policy. If you want an insurance policy
            that builds in value, you may decide that a universal or whole life insurance policy is right for you. This
            is where comparison shopping is best. </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>In simple terms:</dt>
            <dd>Choose what policy type you want – permanent or term</dd>
            <dd>Determine the coverage amount you need and for how long</dd>
            <dd>Speak with an insurance agent to get quotes</dd>
            <dd>Review each quote, comparing them against one another to determine what fits your situation and budget
            </dd>
            <dd>Set up a time for a medical exam if necessary; if not, wait for the company to approve or deny your
              policy
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <p>Yes, you can shop around and get multiple quotes. The key is to ask questions, do your homework, and talk
            with a professional about your situation. From there, you can decide which company is best for you.</p>
          <h6 class="question-title">What Does and Doesn’t Life Insurance Cover?</h6>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>What Is Covered…</strong>
              <p>The key aspect of a life insurance policy is to ensure that your loved ones are taken care of
                financially after you die. You can add more coverage to the policy by covering the potential death of
                your spouse or children. Riders can also help if you become permanently disabled and cannot work or
                become inflicted with a terminal sickness.</p>
              <p>Life insurance will cover the majority of deaths and could include additional benefits if the death is
                deemed accidental. Some policies will permit cash value accrual that can be used without a tax penalty
                after you reach a certain age.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>What Is Not Covered…</strong>
              <p>However, most life insurance policies will not pay out if a person commits suicide within two years of
                the policy becoming active. After this period, the suicide limit is then dropped, and the act is then
                covered by the policy and company. Also, life insurance companies will not pay out benefits if the
                person holding the policy lied when answering the medical questions. </p>
              <p>Some company policies will not pay out death benefits that result from high-risk activities (skydiving,
                bungee jumping, etc.). Your policy lays out the coverage details, so it’s important to talk with a
                professional insurance company to determine what activities are not covered.</p>
              <p>And, though no one wants to think about this, if a beneficiary murders a policyholder, the beneficiary
                will not receive the payout. Instead, it will go to a secondary beneficiary. However, this depends on
                the crime’s nature. </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h6 class="question-title">Should You Get Multiple Life Insurance Policies?</h6>
          <p>If you’re wondering if you can have several active life insurance policies, the answer is yes. Multiple
            life insurance policies protect you in case your life situation changes. For instance, you may opt for a
            $500,000 life insurance policy when you get married. When you purchase a home and grow your family, you may
            decide to buy a $750,000 life insurance policy <a href="/mortgage-loan-calculator" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                                              target="_blank">to ensure your mortgage is paid

          <p>Before choosing which type of loan to go with, it is vital to have knowledge of the lenders that are in the

            attached to them.</p>

          <p>Borrowers also should keep a check on their credit score to be aware that they follow within the minimum
            guidelines of home equity loan providers. It is crucial to know the type of loan one can afford to pay and
