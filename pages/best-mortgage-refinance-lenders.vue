            <p>Mortgage refinancing is the strategy implemented by homeowners with the sole purpose of reducing their monthly payments. This is carried out by replacing their current mortgage with a new mortgage. The new mortgage will have better terms like lower interest rates and mortgage period.</p>

            <p>With mortgage refinancing, people can opt for significant changes in their loan agreement, such as moving from an
            adjustable-rate mortgage to a fixed-rate mortgage that offers greater stability.</p>
