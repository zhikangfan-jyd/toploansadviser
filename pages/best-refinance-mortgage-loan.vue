            If you are planning to buy in the next 45 days, it's important to
            get pre-qualified since many sellers only consider pre-qualified
            offers. Getting pre-qualified is also the next step toward
            pre-approval, where you can lock in your interest rate.With our
            trusted partner, Credible, you can compare prequalified rates from
            up to 12 of the best Mortgage loan companies for in minutes. Plus,
            checking your rates is free and doesn't affect your credit score.

              The process was simple and straightforward. There should be better
              notification that there was an error when we first entered our
              info for the application. We didn't know there was an error until
              we called for status as we hadn't heard in a couple days. I
              thought I'd be on hold for 30-60min. It was about 4min. Very
              helpful and patient and KNOWL-EDGEABLE person assisted. They
              walked me through all the steps (not many) and waited on the line
              while we made the corrections. I have been very happy! With
              multiple kids - this was my 6th year of applying for student loans
              and it was the Best experience by far. Website was straightforward
              after that first error. Write everything down as you pro-vide it:
              email, new password, website. You will need it later most likely!!

              Whether you are buying a home or refinancing one, the mortgage
              process is basically similar to one another. Here is an
              introductory look at what happens when you’re
              mortgaging/refinancing a home:

                  a submitted application. The document needs to entail three
                  things – monthly mortgage rate, estimated interest rate and

                  problems.

            Understanding The Mortgage Interest and How It’s Calculated
          </h2>
          <div class="content">
            <p>
              The mortgage interest rate is the yearly cost of financing your
              home, noted in a percentage of the loan amount. For example, a
              2.75% interest rate on your mortgage means an additional 2.75% on
              the remaining balance is added. 
            </p>
            <p>There are two types of interest rates: fixed and adjustable.</p>
          </div>
          <h2 class="small-title">Fixed-Rate</h2>
          <div class="content">
            <p>
              With a fixed-rate mortgage, the interest rate stays the same
              throughout the life of the loan. This means the monthly mortgage
              payment also remains the same. You don’t have to worry about
              increasing costs, but you don’t benefit unless you choose to
              refinance if the market drops.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fixed-rate mortgages tend to have a higher initial monthly payment
              because the lender is unable to raise the interest rate when the
              market dictates it.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h2 class="small-title">Adjustable-Rate</h2>
          <div class="content">
            <p>
              If you have an adjustable-rate mortgage, the interest rate is tied
              to the market rates. It’s subjected to the market’s movements,
              using a benchmark rate (i.e., prime rate). When the benchmark rate
              increases, your monthly mortgage payment will increase. When it
              falls, your mortgage payment will also decline.
            </p>
            <p>
              This kind of rate is only ideal when you’re going to sell or
              refinance your home before an increase in rates or if you believe
              there were be a decline in the market.
            </p>
            <p>
              How do you know which one is best for you? It will depend on three
              things:

              When it comes to determining your mortgage interest rate, there

              APR denotes the interest rate as well as the origination fees,

          <div class="content">
            <p>
              Your individual situation – plans, preferences and finances – will
              dictate what the best mortgage is. The most common kind of

            </p>
            <h6 class="small-title">Adjustable-Rate Mortgages</h6>
            <p>
              Monthly payments and interest rates are affected by the market,
              which means you could pay more or less during the life of the
              loan. Early adjustable-rate mortgages are low, but rates can spike
              unexpectedly (leaving some borrowers unable to pay).
            </p>
            <h6 class="small-title">Balloon Mortgages</h6>
            <p>
              These are loans with short-term interest payments of five to 10
              years, which then require the homeowner to make a lump sum
              payment. This may be ideal for individuals who are going to sell
              or refinance the home before the impending balloon payment is due.
            </p>
            <h6 class="small-title">Conforming Loans</h6>
            <p>
              The loans are subjected to the limits and guidelines as laid out
              by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
            </p>
            <h6 class="small-title">Conventional Mortgages</h6>
            <p>
              These mortgages originate from private lenders and are not
              federally backed by the government. To qualify, private lenders
              want a minimum 620 credit score, a low debt-to-income ratio and a
              minimum 3% down payment. Any down payment less than 20% must
              include private mortgage insurance.
            </p>
            <h6 class="small-title">Fixed-Rate Mortgages</h6>
            <p>
              Loans with a fixed rate mean payments and interest rate remain the
              same (great for budgeters). However, if the rate falls, you will
              need to refinance if you want to benefit financially. 
            </p>
            <h6 class="small-title">Government-Backed Loans</h6>
            <p>
              These are loans from the Department of Agriculture, Department of
              Veterans Affairs and Federal Housing Administration. If you are
              unable to get a convention loan, you could attain a
              government-backed loan.

                  However, you could be approved if you agree to pay a 10% down

                  in-depth analysis of your financial profile. A lender will

              criteria set forth by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Jumbo loans
              surpass the limits of a conforming loan and have stringent
              qualifications for eligibility due to lenders’ risk.
