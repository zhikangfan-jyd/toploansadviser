If you are a potential homebuyer and are in search of a direct lending service in America, then Zillow Home loans is the mortgage company for you. Zillow is America's biggest online real estate platform, and they have recently <a href="/mortgage-loan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bought a mortgage business</a> to open their own lending platform.

You get mortgage and interest rate calculators on their official website to help estimate the amount you could afford to spend on buying a new home.

First, you have to fill out a short questionnaire on their website to tell about your budget, income, and home buying process you prefer.

Next, an experienced loan officer at Zillow Home loans would contact you and make the entire purchase and refinance process easier for you. Things to keep in mind are that you are not tied to any obligation of taking a Zillow mortgage, and this process does not affect your credit score.

Not everyone can get a Zillow Home Loan. Here is a breakdown of the requirements which must be fulfilled in order to get a Zillow Home Loan:

- For conventional loans, you need a minimum of a 3% down payment. If you are going for a conventional loan and your down payment is not greater than 20%, then you also have to pay for private mortgage insurance( PMI). The PMI adds up to your monthly mortgage payment.
- For FHA loans, you need a minimum of 3.5% down payment. You also need FHA mortgage insurance.
- If you are a veteran or a military member, then you need no down payment or mortgage insurance in order to get VA loans. You would only have to pay a funding fee for VA.

Many mortgage lenders advertise each and every detail about their fees and rates online, but Zillow Home Loans isn't that transparent. To know about rates and get the right information, you have to speak directly to a loan officer.

Conventional loans are offered with 15, 20, and 30-year fixed-rate options, while for FHA and VA, it is 15 and 30 years.

For a VA loan, a credit score of 620 is required by the military homebuyers. USDA requires a credit score of 640 in most cases.
