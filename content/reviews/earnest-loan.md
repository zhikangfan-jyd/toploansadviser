<div class="title-box"><img src="/data/images/r-9.webp"/><h2 class="title">Who Is This Loan Good For?</h2></div>

If you’re looking for a loan service that allows you to customize your repayment schedule or pay off your debt faster without dealing with prepayment penalties, then Earnest is a great option for you. With so many customizable repayment plans, Earnest loans offer you a great way to pay off your college debt quickly by refinancing it. With the ability to increase monthly payments or make multiple payments at once, Earnest allows you to get this burden off your shoulders quickly, if you’ve got the funds to do so.


<div class="title-box"><img src="/data/images/r-10.webp"/><h2 class="title">Requirements</h2></div>

When it comes to financial requirements needed to qualify for an Earnest loan, the minimum credit score you’ll need is 650. You also must have a stream of income or a written job offer with employment starting within the next six months. There is no minimum income requirement, meaning as long as you have some type of income, you’ll be good to go.

Besides connecting the checking account where your income is being deposited, Earnest also allows you to connect savings accounts, investments, or credit cards that can give the company a better insight into your financial situation. The more in-depth you go when showcasing your financial image, the better chances you’ll have at landing lower interest rates (assuming that your financial situation is acceptable).

Other requirements include being a US citizen or having a 10-year green card, having attended a school authorized to receive federal aid, and having graduated. It’s important to mention that Earnest doesn’t allow you to apply with a co-signer. With that said, if your credit score or other financial information is not sufficient to apply for a loan, you will have to look elsewhere.




<div class="title-box"><img src="/data/images/r-11.webp"/><h2 class="title">Rates & Fees</h2></div>

As with many money lending services, Earnest requires a soft credit check before they can let you know what kind of interest rates you qualify for. With that said, the exact interest rates will depend on your credit score and financial situation. The good thing about Earnest is that they don’t charge any application or origination fees and there are no prepayment or late payment fees involved.

That makes Earnest loans one of the best options for those who want to avoid additional payments on top of their loan repayment plan. When it comes to loan amounts, Earnest allows loans ranging from as little as $5 000 all the way to $500 000. Their loan terms range from 5 to 20 years, although they allow you to choose a precise loan term including the month of your final payment.


<div class="title-box"><img src="/data/images/r-12.webp"/><h2 class="title">Repayment Options</h2></div>

Earnest allows academic and military deferment on loan payments, as well as significant forbearance. That means you can postpone payments in increments of three months if you meet certain criteria. This criteria includes getting a decrease in income from a reduction in hours or unpaid leave, losing employment involuntarily, or having a significant increase in emergency expenses such as medical costs or urgent home repair costs. This list also includes unpaid maternity or paternity leave.

If you find yourself in any of these situations, Earnest will allow you to postpone your payment for three months. Moreover, you can skip one month’s payment every 12 months regardless of your situation. However, keep in mind that if you do this, the payments you skip will be spread out across your future payments, which will make them slightly higher. In case of death or disability, the loan will be fully discharged.

What’s great about Earnest is that they have an online system where you can set up monthly or biweekly payments via autopay so you don’t have to manually go through the process every single time. Unfortunately, the company’s old features such as the Earnest mobile app where you could access full payment history and adjust payment due dates is no longer available. This part of the service was removed back in 2017 when Navient took over the company.


<div class="title-box"><img src="/data/images/r-13.webp" /><h2 class="title">Customer Servicet</h2></div>

Earnest loan service has their own in-house customer support team, which is a good sign for those who need help with their loan-related questions. However, the average response time of their customer support team is not disclosed.

<div class="title-box"><img src="/data/images/r-14.svg"/><h2 class="title">Bottom Line</h2></div>

Overall, Earnest is a reputable online lender that allows you to take out private student loans or get refinancing on your old student debt. If you opt for refinancing, you’ll get several options to cut down your debt quickly by making multiple payments at once or increasing your monthly repayment amount.

Either way, Earnest is a great lender offering plenty of repayment plans and lengthy repayment terms of up to 20 years. Keep in mind that you will need to do a soft check with them to see what rates you qualify for. On top of that, you will not be allowed to bring on a co-signer.
