<div class="title-box"><img src="/data/images/r-6.webp"/><h2 class="title">Loan Types</h2></div>

When you have finally decided to <a href="/best-mortgage-refinance-lenders" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">go for the mortgage option</a> to refinance your home or buy a new one, the next step is to decide which kind of mortgage option is best for you. Here are the Loan options available with Rocket Mortgage Loans:


- Adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM)
- Fixed-rate mortgage
- United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) loan
- Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan
- YOURgage
- Veterans Affairs (VA) loan
- Jumbo loans


<div class="title-box"><img src="/data/images/r-11.webp"/><h2 class="title">Rates & Fees</h2></div>

Rocket Mortgage mainly advertises purchase and refinance rates on a day-to-day basis for VA loans, 30-year loans, 15-year loans, and FHA loans. These rates change daily and are dependent upon a few assumptions, including:

- Your credit score is higher than 720
- Your debt-to-income ratio is below 30%

So, not everyone will be able to qualify to get the minimum rates.

The discount rates can include discount points, so be sure to pay heed to the APR and fees. If you need a lower interest rate, then you have to pay a mortgage point or discount point as an optional upfront fee. A discount fee usually costs 1% of the loan balance. Then the rate is reduced by .25%. Therefore, you may have to pay a higher mortgage rate than previously told if you desire to avoid the extra fees.

Basically, the type of loan you are opting for determines the minimum credit score required. You need a minimum score of 620 to get most of the loans, such as VA loans and conventional loans.

You need a minimum credit score of 580 to qualify for FHA loans. This is just an estimate of the minimum credit scores needed to qualify for the loan type. But the people with the highest credit scores are most likely to qualify for the best mortgage rates.

You will have to submit an application to know everything about closing costs, including the discount points and lender fees. You may have to pay late fees, the amount depending on how late you pay your payment. Rocket Mortgage does not have any payment penalties or application fees for any type of its loans.

Rocket Mortgage extends the rate lock with an extra 15 days for free after you lock in your interest rate for 45 days. To cover the rate lock and appraisal, you have to deposit $500. You can apply this deposit for loan costs in the future.

<div class="title-box"><img src="/data/images/r-8.webp"/><h2 class="title">Reputation</h2></div>

One of the most important factors is the reputation and rating of Mortgage Loans. U.S news has given 4.4 out of 5 stars to Rocket Mortgage.

In addition, Rocket Mortgage has been able to get an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau. Trustpilot gave Rocket Mortgage 3.9 out of 5 stars.

Let me briefly tell you about the Rocket Mortgages' overall score:

<div class="title-box"><img src="/data/images/r-9.webp"/><h2 class="title">How Can You Qualify?</h2></div>


The next thing to know after going through the customer's reviews is <a href="/best-fha-lenders" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">who could qualify for Rocket Mortgage</a>. Here is a breakdown of the eligibility criteria for each type of Rocket Mortgage:

- Have a minimum credit score of 580 to qualify for an FHA loan. This also requires a down payment of at least 3.5%.  

- Have a minimum credit score of 620 and qualify for a conventional loan from Rocket Mortgage.


<div class="title-box"><img src="/data/images/r-14.svg"/><h2 class="title">Conclusion</h2></div>

The Detroit-based lender is among the most popular mortgage lenders in the U.S. due to its seamless and digital-first mortgage process. But the ease of application should not be the only thing considered while choosing a lender. But it would help if you also compared the rates of different companies to find out the best deal.
