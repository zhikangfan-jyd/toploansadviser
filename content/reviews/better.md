<div class="title-box"><img src="/data/images/r-9.webp"/><h2 class="title">How Can You Qualify?</h2></div>

In order to be granted a loan, the following points should be taken into consideration. They include:

- Maintain a credit score of 620 or above. In the case of poor credit, take help from someone that has a strong credit line to get a lower interest rate on a loan. Tradelines can be used to increase the credit score as well.

- Keep the debt to income ratio less than 40%. The lower the DTI ratio, the higher is the probability of qualifying for the loan.

- Have ample funds to make the down payment. The minimum down payment for any mortgage is at least 3%, but it can increase up to 20%. So having surplus funds will increase the chances to get the loan.

- Although different loan products have different requirements, to have a decent credit score, an individual should pay his dues on time and lessen the amount of debt owed. This will improve their credit line. As a result, they can be granted a loan.



<div class="title-box"><img src="/data/images/r-11.webp"/><h2 class="title">Rates & Fees</h2></div>

The company offers loans and refinancing mortgages for different loan periods like 15 years, 20 years, or 30 years loans. These loan periods have purchase rates attached to them which are prone to changes. Hence the rates can be decreased through discount points, which is the optional fee paid to the company to lower the rate.

The interest rates are directly proportional to an individual's credit score, such that the higher the score, the lower the interest rate will be. For a conforming loan, the minimum credit score should not be less than 620, and for jumbo loans, it should not be less than 700. If such conditions are not met, the interest rate on loans will be higher.

One good thing about Better Mortgage is that it does not ask for any origination fee at the time of loan approval. The interest rate given the loan again can be locked up, i.e. it can be fixed by paying an additional fee to the company.

Moreover, the company helps eliminate some costs at the borrower's end, such as it does not ask for any application fee, processing fee, underwriting fee, or even prepayment penalties. However, the client is asked to pay mandatory fees and costs like Appraisal fees, Title search and title insurance, recording fees, Escrow deposit, Prepaid interest, and Optional mortgage points.

<div class="title-box"><img src="/data/images/r-14.svg"/><h2 class="title">Conclusion</h2></div>

Better Mortgage is a good choice for people those wish to apply for a loan but does not want to get stuck in paperwork, and that is why its online process will assist them in getting the loan approval with minutes. The company does not ask for several fees and costs, which reduces the burden on the customer, but there are mandatory fees that cannot be waived off.

The company has an outstanding rating from its customers who recommend its services and products to others. While this is the case for most customers, there are some unlucky customers that had a bad experience and wish to discourage others from getting in business with the company.

It is important that people carry out their due diligence on which loan they should apply for and the minimum criteria to qualify. Some common rules to make the approval process a success is to have a good credit score and a low amount of debt. Ample funds could be used to pay for higher interest rates or down payments if the credit score is lower than average.
