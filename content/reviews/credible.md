Shopping for a personal loan can feel overwhelming. How do you know which lender has a program you’ll qualify for? How
many lenders should you try before taking a loan?

The process can be exhausting, but it’s important to try and get the best personal loan deal available. Fortunately, a
marketplace like Credible makes it easier. With 17 lenders in one place and only one form to complete, Credible
simplifies <a href="/guides/how-to-apply-a-personal-loan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the personal loan application process</a>, making it easy to get the loan you need.

Is Credible worth it for you? Read our review below.

<div class="title-box"><img src="/data/images/r-1.webp"/><h2 class="title">Overview</h2></div>

Credible is a marketplace that brings together consumers and lenders. If you like comparison shopping for personal
loans (most people should), you’ll love how easy Credible makes it. Looking online, there are many of personal loan
lenders available. Finding the one that’s right for you can feel like finding a needle in a haystack, not to mention
exhausting as you complete application after application. Luckily, Credible makes it simple.

Credible isn’t a lender. They allow you to
be [prequalified with multiple lenders](/personal-loan) simultaneously
based on the criteria you enter. If you prequalify, lenders will provide rates allowing you to choose the loan you want.
If none of the offers appeal to you, you don’t need to select one and your personal information won’t be shared with any
lenders. This saves you from annoying phone calls from lenders which can happen with other loan comparison sites.

**The best part is getting prequalified rates for a personal loan with Credible doesn’t affect your credit**. Once you
choose a lender complete the lender’s application for a loan, your credit report will show an inquiry. Fortunately, only
one credit inquiry won’t hurt your credit score a lot as it usually only hits your credit a few points.

Are you ready to see if Credible is right for you? Read on.

<div class="title-box"><img src="/data/images/r-5.webp"/><h2 class="title">Qualifying Requirements</h2></div>

Like we said above, you’ll need at least a 600 credit score to qualify with any lenders on Credible. <a href="/guides/how-your-credit-score-affects-your-loan-chances" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">If you aren’t sure
what your credit score is, ask your bank or credit card companies</a> if they provide free access to your credit score (most
do). You can also pull your free credit reports to see if you have any negative information on your credit report.

Go through your credit report and if you see any of the following, try to fix it before applying for a personal loan:

- **Late payments** – Any payments over 30 days past due bring your credit score down considerably. Bring all payments
  current and keep paying them on time to help your credit score increase.
- **Overextended credit** – Keep your credit card balances at 30% or less than your credit line. Any balances exceeding
  30% bring your credit score down and make it harder to qualify for a personal loan.
- **Overextended credit** – Negotiate a settlement on any collection accounts, but include a request to delete the
  collection from your credit report. Just paying it doesn’t get it off your credit report and collections stay there
  for 7 years. Eliminate the collection and you increase your chances of approval.
- **Excessive inquiries** – If you applied for many loans or credit cards recently, it makes lenders worried about
  lending you money. Avoid applying for new credit unless it’s necessary.

Besides your credit, **lenders will look at your income and debts**. Keeping your income as stable as possible is
important. If you change jobs often, it could make lenders wary of lending you money. You want to show that you are
stable and reliable if you want a lender to loan you money.

Your debts play a role too. If you have too much debt outstanding now, the personal loan will only add to it. The
exception to the rule is if <a href="/best-consolidation-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you’re using the personal loan to consolidate your credit card debt</a>. If you will consolidate
the debt, your debt-to-income ratio will likely decrease, which would make the personal loan a good thing.

Just like when you apply with specific lenders yourself, every lender has different qualifying factors. **Applying with
Credible allows you to compare rates from multiple lenders with one simple form**.

To improve your chances of qualifying, we recommend pulling your credit before applying and fixing any issues. Also look
at your current debts, and make sure your income and employment are stable. Most lenders like a 2-year stable employment
history, but if you’ve changed jobs recently, just make sure the income is in line with what you made before and you
have the qualifications to succeed at the job.

<div class="title-box"><img src="/data/images/r-10.webp"/><h2 class="title">Main Loan Features</h2></div>

<a href="/guides/is-an-unsecured-loan-the-right-way-to-go-for-financial-assistance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A personal loan is usually an unsecured loan you borrow</a>. You’ll pay interest and principal monthly right after receiving
the money in one lump sum.

Most loans have a fixed interest rate (the rate doesn’t change) and give you the principal in one payment (direct
deposit in your checking account). Some loans, though, may have a line of credit (similar to a credit card) or have a
variable interest rate.

Read the fine print before accepting a personal loan to make sure you understand the repayment options, how you’re being
charged, and what options you have to prepay the loan if you are able.



<div class="title-box"><img src="/data/images/r-11.webp"/><h2 class="title">Rates & Fees</h2></div>

Like any loan, personal loans charge interest on the money you borrow, and many charge upfront fees, which come out of
the loan proceeds.

The rates and fees lenders charge you depend on a few factors:

- **Qualifying factors** – Lenders look at your credit score, debt-to-income ratio, and employment history to determine
  your likelihood of paying the debt back. If you have great credit scores, a low debt-to-income ratio, and stable
  employment, you’re more likely to get a lower APR and fees than someone with a lower credit score, higher DTI, and
  unstable employment.

- **Loan amount** – Typically, the more money you borrow, the higher the interest rate. A larger loan amount is riskier
  for lenders because if you default, they stand to lose a lot of money.

- **Late payments** – Lenders also ask the reason you want the personal loan. For example, someone borrowing money to
  consolidate credit card debt is a higher risk than someone borrowing to fix up their home. A home equity loan has
  collateral (the home), so if the borrower defaults, the lender can foreclose on the home. There isn’t any collateral
  with a debt consolidation loan. The riskier your loan, the higher the APR lenders will charge.

<div class="title-box"><img src="/data/images/r-12.webp"/><h2 class="title">Loan Process</h2></div>

It’s easy to use the Credible
platform. [You complete one form that takes 2 minutes](https://www.toploansadviser.com/redirect/personal-loan/credible).
In the form, Credible asks pointed questions they use to prequalify you with the 17 lenders on the platform.

Once complete, Credible gets back real prequalified rates from all the lenders you qualified for a loan with. The rates
you receive aren’t estimates, but real rates that if you can prove everything you stated on your application will be
your rates when you close on the loan.

As the offers come in, read the fine print, know the terms, and play around with the numbers. For example, some lenders
may offer a term of 2 years or 5 years – you can play with the numbers to see how the different terms affect your
interest rate and fees.

Once you choose the right offer, you work directly with the lender to close the loan. Sometimes you’ll send in
additional information, such as pay stubs or tax returns to prove your income. Usually, lenders can close and fund the
loan within a matter of days, sending the funds via direct deposit to your bank account.



<div class="title-box"><img src="/data/images/r-13.webp" /><h2 class="title">Customer Support</h2></div>

Credible offers incredible customer support from the moment you land on their website. If you have questions throughout
the application process, they are there to help you. If you have questions any other time, Credible offers support via
phone, email, or online chat to make it easy on customers.



<div class="title-box"><img src="/data/images/r-14.svg"/><h2 class="title">Bottom Line</h2></div>

If you’re in the market for a personal loan and you want to shop around for the best rate, Credible makes it easy. It
doesn’t hurt your credit to apply and you aren’t obligated to take any offers you receive.

Credible is free and if anything, provides you with more knowledge and support than you’d receive trying to find a
personal loan yourself.
