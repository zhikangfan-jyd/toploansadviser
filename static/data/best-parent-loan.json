Now, here’s the thing about federal loans: they usually have a higher interest rate compared to most <a href=\"/guides/what-are-private-student-loans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">private loan options</a> because of the fact that federal repayment plans are much easier to follow through. On top of that, federal loans are eligible for forgiveness programs that take some of the weight off your shoulder in case you’re unable to repay the loan in the future.</p><p>If you want to have those forgiveness programs available, then a federal parent plus loan is a good option to consider. The loan’s interest rate equals around 5.3%. On top of that, there is an origination fee of around 4.2% as well. Keep in mind that these numbers may change as time goes on so make sure to check the exact rates before considering this loan. Finally, this type of loan allows you to borrow the amount of the cost of school’s attendance minus other financial aid you’re receiving. </p><dl><dt>Pros:</dt><dd>Easier repayment plans</dd><dd>Eligible for forgiveness programs</dd></dl><dl><dt>Cons:</dt><dd>High interest rates</dd><dd>You may need an endorser to be able to qualify if your credit score is not good enough.</dd><dd>There’s an origination fee.</dd></dl>"
