      "description": "<p>Haven Life is a well-known digital insurance agency that allows you to purchase high-quality life insurance from the comfort of your home. It offers two term life insurance options – Haven Term and Haven Simple. Haven Term is the longer-term insurance policy with durations between 10–30 years. This plan covers up to $3 million. On the other hand, Haven Simple is a shorter coverage plan with terms between 5–20 years.</p><p>What’s great about Haven Life is that it allows you to apply for both policies online without needing an agent. You won’t even need a medical exam to qualify in many cases. It’s important to mention that both Haven Life insurance policies are limited to people age 64 and under, meaning you will no longer qualify for coverage after age 64. Overall, Haven Life insurance policies are flexible and generous, although they might be more expensive compared to other life insurance policies on the market. If you’re looking for term life insurance and qualify for Haven Life policies without a medical exam, this could be an excellent option to consider.</p><dl><dt>Pros:</dt><dd>Insurance available online</dd><dd>High coverage limits</dd><dd>Certain individuals can qualify without a medical exam</dd><dd>Digital will and fitness app available</dd></dl><dl><dt>Cons:</dt><dd>Only offer term life insurance</dd><dd>Limited to age 64 and under</dd></dl>"
