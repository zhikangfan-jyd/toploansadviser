Monevo themselves don’t set the loan requirements, each lender does, but Monevo uses that information plus the information you share to match you with lenders.</p><p><br/></p><p>Unlike other loan aggregator platforms, Monevo doesn’t advertise a minimum credit score. This doesn’t mean everyone will qualify, though. Lenders set their own requirements and more often than not, a higher credit score means better terms. Monevo has loans for borrowers in all credit tiers from fair credit to excellent credit and everywhere in between.&nbsp;</p><p><br/></p><p>It’s best if you try to get your credit score to at least 620, if not higher. If you need to borrow a higher loan amount, such as $100,000, you’ll need better credit. Lenders need to know that you don’t default on your debts to lend you an unsecured loan of that loan amount. If you have bad credit and need the money, though, see what other factors you have that Monevo lenders would consider good.</p><p><br/></p><p>Other qualifying factors lenders on Monevo require include:</p><p><br/></p><ul class=\"ul1 list-paddingleft-2\" style=\"font-size: medium; white-space: normal; list-style:  disc\"><li><p>Low debt-to-income ratios – Your debt-to-income ratio is a comparison of your monthly debts to your gross monthly income (income before taxes). Ideally, your debt ratio should be 43% or less. If you want the best terms, keep it around 36% for the best results.</p></li><li><p>Stable employment and income – Lenders like stable income and employment. It shows them you are reliable and are likely to repay the debt as required.</p></li><li><p>No collections or recent public records on your credit – Any collections or public records, such as a bankruptcy make it harder to find a lender. If you have collections try negotiating with the collection company to get them settled and removed from your credit report.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><br/></p><p>Most importantly, pay close attention to your credit score. If you don’t know your credit score, check with your bank or credit card company. Most financial institutions provide free access to your credit score.</p><p><br/></p><p>Consumers also have free access to their credit reports annually. Pull your credit report and look for any of the following:</p><p><br/></p><ul class=\"ul1 list-paddingleft-2\" style=\"font-size: medium; white-space: normal; list-style: disc;\"><li><p>Late payments – Any payments over 30 days past due hurt your credit score and make lenders nervous. Take care of any late payments and continue making your payments on time for the best results.</p></li></ul><p><br/></p><ul class=\"ul1 list-paddingleft-2\" style=\"font-size: medium; white-space: normal; list-style: disc;\"><li><p>Overextended credit – Keep your credit card balances at 30% or less of your credit balance. This helps your credit score and shows lenders you use your credit responsibly.</p></li></ul><p><br/></p><ul class=\"ul1 list-paddingleft-2\" style=\"font-size: medium; white-space: normal; list-style: disc;\"><li><p>Don’t apply for credit – Excessive inquiries on your credit report shows lenders you are desperate for the loan. They may think you’re in financial distress and turn down your application.</p></li></ul><p><br/></p><p>The more time you spend working on your credit score, the better the loan terms, APR, loan amount, and fees lenders will offer you.&nbsp;</p>",
