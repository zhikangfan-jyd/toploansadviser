        "overview": "<p>Credible is a marketplace that brings together consumers and lenders. If you like comparison shopping for personal loans (most people should), you’ll love how easy Credible makes it. Looking online, there are many of personal loan lenders available. Finding the one that’s right for you can feel like finding a needle in a haystack, not to mention exhausting as you complete application after application. Luckily, Credible makes it simple.</p><p><br></p><p>Credible isn’t a lender. They allow you to be prequalified with multiple lenders simultaneously based on the criteria you enter. If you prequalify,  lenders will provide rates allowing you to choose the loan you want. If none of the offers appeal to you, you don’t need to select one and your personal information won’t be shared with any lenders. This saves you from annoying phone calls from lenders which can happen with other loan comparison sites. </p><p><br></p><p>The best part is getting prequalified rates for a personal loan with Credible doesn’t affect your credit. Once you choose a lender complete the lender’s application for a loan, your credit report will show an inquiry. Fortunately, only one credit inquiry won’t hurt your credit score a lot as it usually only hits your credit a few points. </p><p><br></p><p>Are you ready to see if Credible is right for you?

        "requirements": "<p>Like we said above, you’ll need at least a 600 credit score to qualify with any lenders on Credible. If you aren’t sure what your credit score is, ask your bank or credit card companies if they provide free access to your credit score (most do). You can also pull your free credit reports to see if you have any negative information on your credit report.&nbsp;</p><p><br/></p><p>Go through your credit report and if you see any of the following, try to fix it before applying for a personal loan:</p><p><br/></p><ul class=\"ul1 list-paddingleft-2\" style=\"font-size: 18px; white-space: normal;list-style: disc;\"><li><p>Late payments – Any payments over 30 days past due bring your credit score down considerably. Bring all payments current and keep paying them on time to help your credit score increase.</p></li><li><p>Overextended credit – Keep your credit card balances at 30% or less than your credit line. Any balances exceeding 30% bring your credit score down and make it harder to qualify for a personal loan.</p></li><li><p>Collection accounts – Negotiate a settlement on any collection accounts, but include a request to delete the collection from your credit report. Just paying it doesn’t get it off your credit report and collections stay there for 7 years. Eliminate the collection and you increase your chances of approval.</p></li><li><p>Excessive inquiries – If you applied for many loans or credit cards recently, it makes lenders worried about lending you money. Avoid applying for new credit unless it’s necessary.</p></li></ul><p><br/></p><p>Besides your credit, lenders will look at your income and debts. Keeping your income as stable as possible is important. If you change jobs often, it could make lenders wary of lending you money. You want to show that you are stable and reliable if you want a lender to loan you money.</p><p><br/></p><p>Your debts play a role too. If you have too much debt outstanding now, the personal loan will only add to it. The exception to the rule is if you’re using the personal loan to consolidate your credit card debt. If you will consolidate the debt, your debt-to-income ratio will likely decrease, which would make the personal loan a good thing.</p><p><br/></p><p>Just like when you apply with specific lenders yourself, every lender has different qualifying factors. Applying with Credible allows you to compare rates from multiple lenders with one simple form.</p><p><br/></p><p>To improve your chances of qualifying, we recommend pulling your credit before applying and fixing any issues. Also look at your current debts, and make sure your income and employment are stable. Most lenders like a 2-year stable employment history, but if you’ve changed jobs recently, just make sure the income is in line with what you made before and you have the qualifications to succeed at the job.&nbsp;</p><p><br/></p>",

You’ll pay interest and principal monthly right after receiving the money in one lump sum. </p><p><br></p><p>Most loans have a fixed interest rate (the rate doesn’t change) and give you the principal in one payment (direct deposit in your checking account). Some loans, though, may have a line of credit (similar to a credit card) or have a variable interest rate. </p><p><br></p><p>Read the fine print before accepting a personal loan to make sure you understand the repayment options, how you’re being charged, and what options you have to prepay the loan if you are able. </p>",
        "rates_fees": "<p>Like any loan, personal loans charge interest on the money you borrow, and many charge upfront fees, which come out of the loan proceeds.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>The rates and fees lenders charge you depend on a few factors:</p><p><br/></p><ul class=\"ul1 list-paddingleft-2\" style=\"font-size: 18px; white-space: normal;list-style: disc;\"><li><p>Qualifying factors – Lenders look at your credit score, debt-to-income ratio, and employment history to determine your likelihood of paying the debt back. If you have great credit scores, a low debt-to-income ratio, and stable employment, you’re more likely to get a lower APR and fees than someone with a lower credit score, higher DTI, and unstable employment.</p></li></ul><p><br/></p><ul class=\"ul1 list-paddingleft-2\" style=\"font-size: 18px; white-space: normal;list-style: disc;\"><li><p>Loan amount – Typically, the more money you borrow, the higher the interest rate. A larger loan amount is riskier for lenders because if you default, they stand to lose a lot of money.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><br/></p><ul class=\"ul1 list-paddingleft-2\" style=\"font-size: 18px; white-space: normal; list-style: disc;\"><li><p>Reason for the loan – Lenders also ask the reason you want the personal loan. For example, someone borrowing money to consolidate credit card debt is a higher risk than someone borrowing to fix up their home. A home equity loan has collateral (the home), so if the borrower defaults, the lender can foreclose on the home. There isn’t any collateral with a debt consolidation loan. The riskier your loan, the higher the APR lenders will charge.&nbsp;</p></li></ul>",

For example, some lenders may offer a term of 2 years or 5 years – you can play with the numbers to see how the different terms affect your interest rate and fees.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you choose the right offer, you work directly with the lender to close the loan. Sometimes you’ll send in additional information, such as pay stubs or tax returns to prove your income.
