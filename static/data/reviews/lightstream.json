    "overview": "<p>Lightstream is an affiliate of SunTrust Bank. It’s the online version of SunTrust Bank, which many people know well. Lightstream offers many benefits, but most notably are their policy for no fees for online loans and the large loan amounts they offer, based on your credit score. <a href=\"/redirect/personal-loan/lightstream\" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer nofollow'>It takes just minutes to apply for a loan on their website</a>; making it easy to get the funds you need fast.</p><p><br/></p><p>Lightstream is flexible in its underwriting and charges its APRs according to your risk level. If you are a ‘risky’ borrower, you’ll pay a higher interest rate, <strong>but you won’t pay any fees as they don’t charge fees on any loan, not even prepayment penalties</strong>.</p>",
    "loan_account": "<p>Lightstream offers loan amounts starting at just $<strong>5,000</strong>. If you just need a small amount to get you by, you’ll get some of the lowest interest rates and shortest terms, allowing you to pay the loan back quickly and with little interest.</p><p><br/></p><p>If your loan needs are greater, Lightstream offers loan amounts up to $100,000. Of course, you must prove that you qualify for a high loan amount by proving that you have the minimum credit score and maximum debt ratio allowed. You may also borrow any amount in between $5,000 - $100,000.</p>",
